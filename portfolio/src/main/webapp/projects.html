              An iOS App where you can get recommendations 
              from your friends on what tv shows to watch next.

              I had intended for this project to be a way that 
              people can favorite tv shows and then share those 
              with their friends, and similarly, see their friends’ 
              favorite shows. I’m currently using an imported JSON 
              file with a list of movies because I wasn’t able to 
              find a JSON file of tv shows or get a tv show API 
              working properly. All the rest of the features are 
              the same as what I had intended for them to be though. 
              I think from here, I will look more into tv show apis 
              or possibly switch to just using movies altogether. I 
              also plan on making the user accounts more interactive 
              with each other.

            <div class="project-description">
              An implementation of a one player Tic Tac Toe 
              against a computer AI (iOS App).
            </div>
            <p class="project-explanation">
              I’ve implemented the classic game of Tic Tac Toe 
              as a one player game against the computer, where 
              the player is assumed to move when the prompt 
              “Your Turn” is given. The game will count your 
              score, and will also allow you to clear the board. 
              The computer AI is designed such that it makes the move 
              that would be the best response given the player’s move, 
              assuming that the player too is playing optimally. This 
              has been done using an algorithm known as the minimax 
              algorithm, which recursively chooses the optimal move 
              for the computer based on which strategy minimises the 
              maximum loss. Since the computer moves optimally, if the 
              player plays optimally as well, they will at best tie with 
              the computer. Thus, their score will increase when the game 
              ends in a tie. The sounds used when winning (tied game) 
              and losing are from Super Mario Bros.

              Find best way to get to a destination (Java). 
              I worked on this project with two of my peers.

              Our project allows users to find a city to travel to in 
              the United States and provides them with the best flight 
              route. We do this by allowing them to choose from 7 key 
              words that are common traits and attraction people look 
              for when they are planning to travel. We then provide them 
              with a list of cities which have their chosen attribute. 
              The user then specifies their date and airport of departure 
              and the program provides them with the best flight route to 
              travel one.  For example if they are departing from Philadelphia 
              and want to go to a place that has beaches, we would see what 
              destinations fit the requirements and recommend cities. The 
              user will then input their date and airport of departure and 
              we will find the possible flights routes alongside their prices. 
              The best route, which is the cheapest route to the chosen 
              destination, will be displayed to the user.
