              An implementation of a one player Tic Tac Toe
              against a computer AI (iOS App).
            </div>
            <p class="project-explanation">
              I’ve implemented the classic game of Tic Tac Toe
              as a one player game against the computer, where
              the player is assumed to move when the prompt
              “Your Turn” is given. The game will count your
              score, and will also allow you to clear the board.
              The computer AI is designed such that it makes the move
              that would be the
              <span style="font-weight: bold">
              best response</span>
              given the player’s move,
              assuming that the player too is playing optimally.
              This means that the player will
              <span style="font-weight: bold">
              at best tie</span>
              with the computer. Thus, their score will increase when 
              the game ends in a tie.

              Our project allows users to
              <span style="font-weight: bold">
              find a city to travel to in the US</span>
              and provides them with the
              <span style="font-weight: bold">
              best flight route</span>
              . We do this by allowing them to
              choose from 7 key words that are common traits people look
              in a travel destination. We then provide them
              with a list of cities which have their chosen attribute.
              The user then specifies their date and airport of departure,
              and the program provides them with the best flight route.
