          <p>
            In high school, I was always challenged by my Math
            and Physics classes. Even in Economics, which at times
            seemed intuitive, there was always more to learn,
            especially when it came to understanding current events
            in the context of frameworks learned in the classroom.
            These subjects intrigue me, they pushed me to learn more,
            to achieve more - which is why I chose to study Computer
            Science with a minor in Economics at the University of
            Pennsylvania. As an aspiring “computer scientist” - as
            I sometimes refer to myself, even though I’m only a rising
            junior - there is always something exciting on my plate:
            an unfinished group project, a new programming language
            to learn, or some code that could be more efficient.
            Despite many sleepless nights, I have learned the most
            fascinating things. I want to be a software engineer
            when I graduate from college. My recent conversations
            with software engineers have convinced me that I would
            love it. It is no secret that our life is becoming more
            and more driven by technology, and I’m really excited to
            get involved in the development of this new and exciting
            world, with applications that are likely to change the
            very way in which we live, work and play.
